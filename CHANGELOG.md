Theatherflix Changelog file
-----------------------------------------
#
NEXT DEVELOPMENT? WHAT'S FORTHCOMING ?
#

-we're moving to React - Redux the whole project will be unstable. To make it fast? Help out!

2017: (future version)
-Future: creating an algorithm for AI. Why? to read an specific folder for movies or an external source, loading atuomatically movies and its images or sources related. The code behind Theatherflix will learn by itself. 
-Perhaps using mongoDB - For some functionalities. Not sure. Ideas?
-create a different way to stream the videos (movies)... Perhaps we will have to work a lot in the back end.
-Another thing: the folder movies-db should be changed by the sync path that automatically read the back end of the system. It could read any port of any devide, sorta like USB. 
-We must to create a way to load the images of the movies, or load an specific icon, or to load the images that are related with the movie (in the external HD) sorta like reading the metadata ... or something like that. Otherwise just an icon. How? we gotta engineer that. 
-Moving to React! 5-2-1018 (Doing now)






#
What do we have now? present stages.
#
-the movies are lolcally in the folder path:
public/movies-db (There will be just one movie partially available to watch for testing pusposes perhaps.)
-the interface is being handled with handlebars.
-We just use Express and handlebars right now for the interface. I intented to use Grunt.js - By Felipe.

Other data to add or comments :

#

#
Notes:
#
-The movie folder 'movies-db' must be created and stored with *.mp4 files in order to list movies.
Additionally you must get the images related with the movie and put them in the folder 'movies-imgs'.
