## Installation
To run the Theatherflix web app offline, you need to install the following;

1. Make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Versions 6.0.0 and higher should work. We recommend that you use the most-recent "Active LTS" version of Node.js.
2. Make sure you have installed `npm` (NB: `npm` is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer).   

### Check that you have node and npm installed

- To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:

`node -v`

- To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:

`npm -v`

## Quick Start

2. `node app.js`
3. Open <http://localhost:3000>
